from the project directory, compile with:
javac -d ./bin/ ./src/*.java
This will put exectuables and classes in the bin folder

from the bin folder in the project directory, run with
java Asst2TestDriver MyObjInspector


Note:
The test driver tries to do the String.class in its last test, the object inspector WILL fail on this test. There is a NullPointerException that I can
not figure out at this time. This will have to be fixed at a later date.

There are no unit tests included.
