Refactor 1: Large Method -> Extracted Method
	inspectFields was doing too much, extracted another method out of it (inspectSuperclass)
	Really it was just poor design trying to inspect fields and superclasses
	Reference number: 59f244f
	
Refactor 2: Duplicated code -> Extracted Method
	was constantly calling the same set of methods over and over, pulled all references to them and made a method out of it (inspectAll)
	Reference number: 863fcbf
	
Refactor 3: Pulled-up Field
	The hashMap was constantly being used, made this a private static field instead of passing around the method
	The motivation here was to improve the hierarchy inspection
	This also removed the need for inspectAll so, so the method was removed
	Reference number: 6b9e9e0

Refactor 4: Removed Parameter
	Most of the methods required the Object but never used it, removed this parameter
